## Applying-Machine-learning-to-financial-aid-policy
**Problem Statement**: You are given a dataset containing details of Financial aid applicants such as their Electricity bill, School_fees, Income class they belong to etc. We can automate the Financial Aid approval process which will save both time and effort. 

We will build a simple logistic regression algorithm that can correctly classify two things.

1.   Is the applicant eligible for Financial aid.
2.   If yes, then how much should be the waiver.

I've also uploaded the demo financial aid dataset.
